# jisho-cli
CLI-interface for Jisho.org API written in pure bash. Some ideas were borrowed from this repo [jisho-cli](https://github.com/brunnerh/jisho-cli). This script gets it's data directly from the [jisho.org api](https://jisho.org/forum/54fefc1f6e73340b1f160000-is-there-any-kind-of-search-api) so atleast in theory, it should be faster than downloading the result page and parsing it to get the data.

Getting kanji details cannot be done with the API currently, so that needs to be still scraped from the website.
